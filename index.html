	<h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
	<h4>A Computer Science student with career interests in tech.</h4>

	<h3>Intro</h3>
	<h4>My name is Rashmi Khadka, and I’m currently pursuing an Associate Degree in Computer Science at LaGuardia Community College. I came to the U.S. in Fall 2022 and previously studied at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville before transferring to LAGCC. I’ve always been passionate about technology and hope to become a software engineer. Outside of academics, I enjoy traveling, listening to music, and exploring new places. Originally from Nepal, I love the diversity in New York and look forward to learning, growing, and meeting new people here. </h4>
