		<h2>Meet Rashmi !!</h2>
	<h4>My name is Rashmi Khadka, and I’m currently pursuing an Associate Degree in Computer Science at LaGuardia Community College. I came to the U.S. in Fall 2022 and previously studied at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville before transferring to LAGCC. I’ve always been passionate about technology and hope to become a software engineer. Outside of academics, I enjoy traveling, listening to music, and exploring new places. Originally from Nepal, I love the diversity in New York and look forward to learning, growing, and meeting new people here. I love diving into new technologies, participating in coding challenges, and collaborating on meaningful projects. 
    My goal is to build tools that make life easier. Whether it's developing user-friendly websites or learning data analysis, I’m always excited to grow and help others along the way.</h4>
